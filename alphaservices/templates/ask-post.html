    We currently support AI related questions answering for relative engineers and learners.
    Our system backend is based on large corpus infromation aggregation.
    currently ,our kwnledge data base is extracted from:<br/>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> </li>
    <li><a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/">Crossvalidated</a> </li>
    <li><a href="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/">Artificial Intelligence</a> </li>
    <li><a href="https://ai.stackexchange.com/">Data Science</a> </li>
    </ul>
    besides, we are now gathering AI related corpus from <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">wikipedia</a>
    to extend the current knowledge base.<br/>
    The core part of the system is a ngram hashing(murmurhash3) retrieval model and a multi-task fine-uning
    Semantic Understanding Model sharing some weights of
    google Bert Base.
